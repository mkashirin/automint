# 🖼️ Automint

This is going to be a bot-like program aimed to perform Solana NFT
operations automatically.

## 🧪 Testing

To run Solana program tests execute the following line (assuming you're in the
project root):
```sh
bash "./test_sbf.sh"
```

## 🚧 Project Status

The project is now in the (not really active) development state. But it aims
to:
- Mint NFTs as soon as they become available for minting;
- Schedule mint/transfer of NFTs.
